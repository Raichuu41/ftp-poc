# FTP_POC - Dockerfile Creator for custom stacks
FTP_POC allows the user to create his own custom stack (Dockerfile) for the online cloud solution in an easily accessible user-friendly way.
Select the available options to create your own suitable Dockerfile. An advanced mode with an editable preview of the Dockerfile is available if the available options are not enough.

# Live Deployment
Check out this [live deployment](https://romanpulgrabja.github.io/FTP_POC/) to see the Dockerfile Creator live in action based on the current master branch.

# Notes for contributors
Do not upload files from the .idea folder. These files are custom to each individual, created by the PyCharm IDE. Uploading them will only cause merge conflicts each time someone tries to merge his contributions to the master. The .gitignore file is there to ignore anything located in the .idea folder.
Please clone the repository once before starting, if you already worked on the repository before (otherwise it will mess up your workspace).
